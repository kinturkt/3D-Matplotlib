# 3D-Matplotlib

Here, I have used three dimensional figures using Matplolib. Some three-dimensional plotting utilities were built on top of Matplotlib's two-dimensional display, and the result is a convenient (if somewhat limited) set of tools for three-dimensional data visualization. three-dimensional plots are enabled by importing the mplot3d toolkit.
Also, if we want to, we save the visualized image on our disk using matplotlib's savefig() method.
Using 3 dimensional figuere makes it easy to distriute & visualize the data.
